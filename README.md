# websocket-tcp-bridge-in-go

The purpose of this project is to enable us communicate with a TCP server using a web browser. This is very useful when you need to remotely control an IoT device 
through a Wireless Sensor Network gateway which needs to use strictly TCP protocol to send/receive information to/from a web server.

This 'bridge' server is written in golang, communicating with another TCP server developed in node js, which in turn communiactes to the gateway device (via cellular network using GSM) installed at a weather station in the range of a wireless sensor network for capturing weather information from environment detcting sensors.
